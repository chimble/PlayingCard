# PLAYINGCARD BLACKJACK


###To play this game, simply run playingcard.py in python3.
###The game will give you your two starting cards
###and also the dealer's one visible card.
###The goal is to either hit (get new card) or stand(stop)
###until your cards are equal to 21 or as close as possible
###After that (assuming you dont go over 21), thd dealer
###will get an opportunity to hit or stand until he chooses.
###Because the dealer goes second, his second card is hidden.
###As you or the dealer hits, your hand values will be updated.
###After you bust (over 21) you will lose and dealer will win.
###Aces can count as either 1 or 11 points in this game.
